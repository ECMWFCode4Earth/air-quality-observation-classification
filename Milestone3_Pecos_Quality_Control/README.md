# Description
Validating and removing errors outliers from surface air quality observations from individual sensors so that these observation can be compared to ECMWF's CAMS air quality forecasts. By clustering analysis on these observations more reliable observations can be identified. Enhancing these observations by attaching data about factors that affect air quality these observations can have more credibility about their accuracy. CAMS lacks credible surface air quality observations in many parts of the world, often in the most polluted area such as in India or Africa. Some observations are available for these areas from data harvesting efforts such as openAQ but there is no quality control applied to the data, and it is often not well known if the observations are made in a rural, urban or heavily polluted local environment. This information on the environment is important because the very locally influenced measurements are mostly not representative for the horizontal scale (40 km) of the CAMS forecasts and should therefore not be used for the evaluation of the CAMS model.

# Aims 

## 1 Choose an upper bound of values and identify value over to be outliers by searching openAQ dataset

Quality Control Defininition: "check if data is within expected bounds. i.e. below Upper Bound. Range tests are very flexible. The test can be used to check for expected range on the raw data or using modified data"

## 2 Choose a lower bound of values 

Quality Control Defininition: "check if data is over expected lower bounds. Range tests are very flexible. The test can be used to check for expected range on the raw data or using modified data"

## 3 Choose an increment on measurements that is acceptable for both increasing and decreasing values 

Quality Control Defininition: "check for stagnant data and abrupt changes in data. Checks if the difference between consecutive data values (or other specified increment) is within expected bounds"

## 4 Find how many stations donâ€™t measure every 15 minutes through a day and when these are

Quality Control Defininition: "check the time index for missing, duplicate, and non-monotonic indexes"

## 5 Find stagnant measurements that don't change over a chosen amount 

Quality Control Defininition: "check for stagnant data and abrupt changes in data. The test checks if the difference between the minimum and maximum data value within a moving window is within expected bounds"

## 6 Find outliers due to a test on a selection of measurements. 

Quality Control Definition: "check if normalized data falls outside expected bounds. Data is normalized using the mean and standard deviation, using either a moving window or using the entire data set."
